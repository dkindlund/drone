model_2_protobuf

Creates a protocolbuffer definition file for a given set of models.  Any models
you'd like to include should be set in "config/protocolbuffer.yml" using the 
file name of the model.  Only relationships to models in the configuration list
will be included in the definition file. For example if the configured list of
models is:

- A
- B

and A contains a (has_many) relationship to C, the relationship will be ignored since
C is not included in the list.

How to use:

rake protobuf:create
